The waiters were also very nice.\nWe didn’t really like the beer selection on tap so I ended up going for the ginger beer.\nWe both ordered the rump steak with chips and salad which was on the specials menu. The steaks were average but overcooked and the chips were easily forgettable. Additionally, the gravy was mid, didn’t have the greatest flavour nor the best consistency but still did the job. We were recommended a very nice red wine to pair with our steak which was probably the highlight of the whole meal.\nWhat we ordered: # Olives Rump Steak Sticky Date Pudding Drinks: # Little Dragon Ginger Beer Grenache ","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1755694128280-the-verandah-beecroft/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Verandah Beecroft","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italian","type":"tags"},{"content":" A very centrally located but hidden restaurant, packed with a menu full of choice and taste. The food and drinks were all served extremely quickly and in perfect order that we were in and out of the door well within an hour. The garlic bread, while simple, was a highlight, perfectly soft and soaked in the garlic butter it melted in the mouth and provided an amazing start to the meal. We weren’t sure if the “combo schnitzel” was going to come chopped up in the pasta or on the side, and unfortunately for me it came in a very small portion on the side. I still ended up chopping it up and smothering it in the pasta sauce which was very nice. The actual pasta was very nice with small bits of bacon that didn’t get in the way of the sauce but perfectly blended in. The sauce was also perfectly thick so that it stuck to the fettuccine and covered it. In comparison to a Vapiano pasta I would consider this much nicer. The lasagne was okay. The meat sauce was strong and bitter and there was not enough béchamel sauce for my personal liking. The pasta was hard on the corners where it hadn’t been cooked properly but otherwise was soft and yummy. Overall, it was a nice dinner however next time I will not order the lasagne.\nWhat we ordered: # Garlic Bread Meat Lasagne Fettuccine Carbonara with Schnitzel Drinks: # Merlot Peroni ","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1754215546635-next-door-cbd/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Next Door CBD","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pasta/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pasta","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
