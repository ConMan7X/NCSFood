[{"content":"This was a very hyped up meal that exceeded expectations, and was an amazing experience from start to finish. Nicole had already been here but was re-experiencing it with Connor, and ended up having a different opinion that when she started.\nTo start, the service was very very good, we were treated very nicely and looked after throughout the whole meal by a large array of individuals who all knew a lot about what they were serving. It made the whole experience very easy and enjoyable.\nWe both enjoyed the \u0026ldquo;vibe\u0026rdquo; of the restaurant (that we were appreciating in detail without any phones) and spent some time looking at all of the interesting artworks they had.\nFor the food, it was all absolutely delicious. The starter was the complimentary beef tallow candle served with some beautifully fluffy bread. We then ordered our cocktail which was a nice lemony prosecco drink, and we cannot recommend that one more.\nWe went for quite a large cut for 2 people, confirmed with us at 850g, so it took around 30 minutes to cook. We made the decision to not order any starters and instead wait for (and prepare for) our main with sides.\nThe steak was beautifully juicy and seasoned, Nicole thought that it may have been too salted but Connor disagrees and thinks it was perfectly flavoured. The salad and potato were also very nice sides which complemented the meal well. In the end we had so much food that we could barely finish it! Definitely no room for dessert after this one.\nOverall, Connor would consider this up the top of his list of best steaks, however for Nicole, a steak from Leogate Estate in the Hunter Valley still holds a special place in her heart.\nWhat we ordered: # Radicchio, burnt orange, green olive, feta Roast potato, fermented chilli mayo, tomato salt 850g Bistecca alla Fiorentina Drinks: # YUZU SGROPPINO 2022 Domus Vini Sangiovese ","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1759309497957-bistecca/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"BISTECCA","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"NCSFood","summary":"","title":"NCSFood","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/special-event/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Special Event","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/steak/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Steak","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wine/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wine","type":"tags"},{"content":" A very nice restaurant with a good view of Darling Harbour, accompanied by a delicious meal. The service here was a main highlight, being very welcoming and nice.\nWe went straight in and ordered mains when we got there, and the choices on the menu were overwhelming but everything was so well explained it was easy to figure out what would be the nicest to order.\nThe steak was very beautiful, and we attempted to cut it up smaller and eat slower so that the end of the steak wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come as quickly. The Rib-Eye was a beautifully juicy cut that deserved to be eaten without any sauce. We did order pepper sauce, but that was reserved for the fattiest bites of steak. Connor found that his steak may have been slightly overcooked in comparison to other medium-rare steaks he\u0026rsquo;s had, but Nicole would disagree and affirm that her steak was perfectly cooked.\nThe chips and mash were also very nice, and despite possibly being simple, they held their own and stood out from other sides at other restaurants. Our other sides were also very nice and flavourful and a nice change from our normal order of broccolini.\nOverall, we would say that Steersons was a very nice experience with a unique offering but we have had nicer steaks and nicer meals (for a cheaper price as well).\nWhat we ordered: # Grasslands Pasture Fed Beef, NSW: Rib-Eye 300g Sides of Chips and Mashed Potato Seasonal Greens Peas Glazed Heirloom Carrots Drinks: # St Hugo Barossa 2021 ","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1758678466645-steersons/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Steersons","type":"posts"},{"content":" Steak with a Darling Harbour View! Perfect location to get drinks before and Yo Chi after, and on Saturday like we experienced to see the fireworks!\nThe service was very nice, but seemed unpolished. It took a while to get our reserved table, we didn’t get a drinks menu, it took a while to order our drinks. But the food came out very quickly!\nOut of our two steaks, we both agreed that the Medallion was much nicer, a lot more juicy and flavourful. The Sirloin was fattier, but not a nice fat, it was very tough and a tiny bit overcooked. The steak was placed on a cutting board with paper, this paper then became annoying when trying to cut the steak.\nThe sides were a salad or chips, with the salad being very boring and not having enough dressing but the chips were nice.\nWe also got the truffle mash and broccolini as well, which were both surprisingly very nice.\nThe highlight for both of us however was the creamy garlic sauce, which when smothered all over the sirloin made for a very nice bite. The red wine just was not a favourite.\nWhat we ordered: # Truffle Mash Steamed Broccolini Medallion w/Creamy Garlic Sauce + Chips Sirloin w/Red Wine Jus + Side Salad Drinks: # Seppelt The Drives Shiraz ","date":"23 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1756022761047-meat-district-co./","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Meat District Co.","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bowlo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bowlo","type":"tags"},{"content":" Amazing vibe and crowd for a bowling club, with a great bar and even special cocktails! The waiters were also very nice.\nWe didn’t really like the beer selection on tap so I ended up going for the ginger beer.\nWe both ordered the rump steak with chips and salad which was on the specials menu. The steaks were average but overcooked and the chips were easily forgettable. Additionally, the gravy was mid, didn’t have the greatest flavour nor the best consistency but still did the job. We were recommended a very nice red wine to pair with our steak which was probably the highlight of the whole meal.\nWhat we ordered: # Olives Rump Steak Sticky Date Pudding Drinks: # Little Dragon Ginger Beer Grenache ","date":"9 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1755694128280-the-verandah-beecroft/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Verandah Beecroft","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/italian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Italian","type":"tags"},{"content":" A very centrally located but hidden restaurant, packed with a menu full of choice and taste. The food and drinks were all served extremely quickly and in perfect order that we were in and out of the door well within an hour. The garlic bread, while simple, was a highlight, perfectly soft and soaked in the garlic butter it melted in the mouth and provided an amazing start to the meal. We weren’t sure if the “combo schnitzel” was going to come chopped up in the pasta or on the side, and unfortunately for me it came in a very small portion on the side. I still ended up chopping it up and smothering it in the pasta sauce which was very nice. The actual pasta was very nice with small bits of bacon that didn’t get in the way of the sauce but perfectly blended in. The sauce was also perfectly thick so that it stuck to the fettuccine and covered it. In comparison to a Vapiano pasta I would consider this much nicer. The lasagne was okay. The meat sauce was strong and bitter and there was not enough béchamel sauce for my personal liking. The pasta was hard on the corners where it hadn’t been cooked properly but otherwise was soft and yummy. Overall, it was a nice dinner however next time I will not order the lasagne.\nWhat we ordered: # Garlic Bread Meat Lasagne Fettuccine Carbonara with Schnitzel Drinks: # Merlot Peroni ","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1754215546635-next-door-cbd/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Next Door CBD","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pasta/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pasta","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
