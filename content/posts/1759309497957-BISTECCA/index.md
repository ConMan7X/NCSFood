This was a very hyped up meal that exceeded expectations, and was an amazing experience from start to finish. Nicole had
already been here but was re-experiencing it with Connor, and ended up having a different opinion that when she started.

To start, the service was very very good, we were treated very nicely and looked after throughout the whole meal by a
large array of individuals who all knew a lot about what they were serving. It made the whole experience very easy and
enjoyable.

We both enjoyed the "vibe" of the restaurant (that we were appreciating in detail without any phones) and spent some
time looking at all of the interesting artworks they had.

For the food, it was all absolutely delicious. The starter was the complimentary beef tallow candle served with some
beautifully fluffy bread. We then ordered our cocktail which was a nice lemony prosecco drink, and we cannot recommend
that one more.

We went for quite a large cut for 2 people, confirmed with us at 850g, so it took around 30 minutes to cook. We made the
decision to not order any starters and instead wait for (and prepare for) our main with sides.

The steak was beautifully juicy and seasoned, Nicole thought that it may have been too salted but Connor disagrees and
thinks it was perfectly flavoured. The salad and potato were also very nice sides which complemented the meal well. In
the end we had so much food that we could barely finish it! Definitely no room for dessert after this one.

Overall, Connor would consider this up the top of his list of best steaks, however for Nicole, a steak from
Leogate Estate in the Hunter Valley still holds a special place in her heart.
