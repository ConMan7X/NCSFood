This was a very hyped up meal that exceeded expectations, and was an amazing experience from start to finish. Nicole had
already been here but was re-experiencing it Connor, and ended up having a different opinion that when she started.

To start, the service was very very good, we were treated very nicely and looked after throughout the whole meal by a
large array of individuals who all knew a lot about what they were serving. It made the whole experience very easy and
enjoyable.

We both enjoyed the "vibe" of the restaurant (that we were appreciating in detail without any phones) and spent some
time looking at all of the interesting artworks they had.

For the food, it was all absolutely delicious. The starter was the complimentary beef tallow candle served with some
beautifully fluffy bread. We then ordered our cocktail which was a nice lemony prosecco drink, and we cannot reccomend
that one more.

We went for quite a large cut for 2 people, confirmed with us at 850g, so it took around 30 minutes to cook. We made the
decision to not order any starters and instead wait for (and prepare for) our main with sides.

## What we ordered:

- Radicchio, burnt orange, green olive, feta
- Roast potato, fermented chilli mayo, tomato salt
- 850g Bistecca alla Fiorentina

## Drinks:

- YUZU SGROPPINO
- 2022 Domus Vini Sangiovese
