![Steak dinner with wine in Steersons](featured.jpeg)

A very nice restaurant with a good view of the harbour, accompanied by a delicious
meal. The service here was a main highlight, being very welcoming and nice.

We went straight in and ordered mains when we got here, and the choices on the menu
were overwhelming but everything was so well explained it was easy to figure out
what would be the nicest to order.

## What we ordered:

- Grasslands Pasture Fed Beef, NSW: Rib-Eye 300g
- Sides of Chips and Mashed Potato
- Seasonal Greens
- Peas
- Glazed Heirloom Carrots

## Drinks:

- St Hugo Barossa 2021
