![Steak dinner with wine in Steersons](featured.png)

A very nice restaurant with a good view of Darling Harbour, accompanied by a delicious
meal. The service here was a main highlight, being very welcoming and nice.

We went straight in and ordered mains when we got there, and the choices on the menu
were overwhelming but everything was so well explained it was easy to figure out
what would be the nicest to order.

The steak was very beautiful, and we attempted to cut it up smaller and eat slower
so that the end of the steak wouldn't come as quickly. The Rib-Eye was a beautifully
juicy cut that deserved to be eaten without any sauce. We did order pepper sauce,
but that was reserved for the fattiest bites of steak. Connor found that his steak
may have been slightly overcooked in comparison to other medium-rare steaks he's had,
but Nicole would disagree and affirm that her steak was perfectly cooked.

The chips and mash were also very nice, and despite possibly being simple, they
held their own and stood out from other sides at other restaurants. Our other sides
were also very nice and flavourful and a nice change from our normal order of
broccolini.

Overall, we would say that Steersons was a very nice experience with a unique offering
but we have had nicer steaks and nicer meals (for a cheaper price as well).

- Grasslands Pasture Fed Beef, NSW: Rib-Eye 300g
