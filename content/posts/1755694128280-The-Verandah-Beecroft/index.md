# The Verandah Beecroft

Amazing vibe and crowd for a bowling club, with a great bar and even special cocktails! The waiters were also very nice.

We didn’t really like the beer selection on tap so I ended up going for the ginger beer.

We both ordered the rump steak with chips and salad which was on the specials menu. The steaks were average but overcooked and the chips were easily forgettable. Additionally, the gravy was mid, didn’t have the greatest flavour nor the best consistency but still did the job.
We were recommended a very nice red wine to pair with our steak which was probably the highlight of the whole meal.

## What we ordered:

- Olives
- Rump Steak
- Sticky Date Pudding

## Drinks:

- Little Dragon Ginger Beer
- Grenache
